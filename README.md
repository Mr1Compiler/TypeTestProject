Adding ReadME file


About the Project:
This is my first application developed in C#. While I have completed several smaller C# projects for practice, this is my initial foray into a more substantial application.

The app is a typing practice tool that allows users to choose random paragraphs to enhance their typing speed. Users can also add their own custom paragraphs by pressing the "+" icon located at the top. You can edit your selections and adjust the timer duration (up to three minutes) through the settings. Additionally, you have the option to enable or disable certain features via the "View" settings.

While this application has room for improvement and could benefit from additional features, I aimed to keep it simple to focus on practicing WinForms and C#.
Thank you for taking the time to check it out!
